<blockquote>
<p>
Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of
programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a
computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to
human beings what we want a computer to do.
</p>

<p>
The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an
essayist, whose main concern is with exposition and excellence of
style. Such an author, with thesaurus in hand, chooses the names of
variables carefully and explains what each variable means. He or
she strives for a program that is comprehensible because its
concepts have been introduced in an order that is best for human
understanding, using a mixture of formal and informal methods that
reinforce each other.
