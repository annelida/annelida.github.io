<h2 id="org8871b24">Preamble</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8871b24">
<p>
There are six levels or types of thinking that every student or
learner, regardless of age, should master. Each of these levels leads
to a different outcome. Unfortunately, most of the students I work
with are stuck at the first few levels of thinking. The reason they
struggle to achieve top results is that they are thinking at the wrong
level. This situation can cause a lot of stress, waste time, and lead
to frustration. It may feel impossible to reach high results with any
degree of confidence, and over time, one might start to think they are
simply not cut out for success. However, this is probably not true.
</p>

<p>
For me, learning how to think deliberately at the right level is one
of the main reasons I was able to achieve top academic results in both
medical school and my Master’s in Education. Trust me, I’m certainly
not a genius. I have seen similar results with thousands of students
and professionals I have trained over the years. By the end of this
video, you'll be able to identify the level you tend to operate at and
learn how to reach the level you need to be at.
</p>

<p>
It’s worth noting that the level you need to reach is likely higher
than you think, but we’ll discuss that later.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3dfad41" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3dfad41">The First Level: "Remembering"</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3dfad41">
<p>
The first level <i>focuses on memorization</i>. This involves a lot of
rereading and rewriting, and is usually very repetitive. It can feel
tedious and often makes us drowsy. This level is called "Remembering."
It involves rote learning and repeating hundreds or thousands of
flashcards. This is how I, and perhaps you, studied in high school,
and it may be the reason why you disliked studying. When you think and
study at this level, you unlock the "Regurgitation" result. This level
is about listing, defining, and stating facts. These kinds of
questions become less common in university and are mostly useless in
professional life. Confusingly, even though this first level is called
"Remembering," it is not an effective way to retain what you
learn. We’ll address that later.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb8dc68a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb8dc68a">The Second level: "Understanding"</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb8dc68a">
<p>
The second level of learning <i>focuses on truly comprehending</i> what you
are studying, rather than just repeatedly trying to cram information
into your brain. This level is called "Understanding." There’s a
reason I refer to these as levels of thinking rather than levels of
studying: your intentions matter. Two people could use exactly the
same technique, and from an outsider’s perspective, it might look
identical. When asked how they study, one might say, “I’m just reading
my textbook”— but mentally, they are in different places. The person
at level one might mean, “I’m rereading it over and over to get it
stuck in my head,” whereas the person at level two is reading to truly
understand what the content is communicating.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, at level two thinking "Understanding" we unlock the ability
to "Explain." This skill allows us to answer questions that require us
to clarify our understanding of a concept or process. Such questions
often constitute the bulk of assessments until later in university.
</p>

<p>
If this sounds familiar, it’s because it aligns with a framework
called Bloom’s Revised Taxonomy, which was first published in 1956 and
later revised in 2001. Despite being over 70 years old, it remains one
of the most underrated principles that most students have never heard
of. If you have heard of it, stick around because I'll teach you a
method of using it that helped me double my learning efficiency.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org14249b4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org14249b4">The Third Level: "Applying"</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org14249b4">
<p>
Level three involves using what you have learned to solve
problems. This level is known as "Applying." Here, things can become
slightly confusing because many misunderstand Bloom’s Taxonomy. There
are various ways to apply your knowledge in problem-solving. For
example, consider "simple problems," where you learn something and
directly use that knowledge to solve a problem. In math or physics,
you might learn an equation or formula to solve a specific problem
requiring that equation.
</p>

<p>
Then there are more advanced problems, where you must think
strategically about the best way to tackle the issue. This involves
combining concepts in a specific sequence, which requires more
strategic thinking. At level three, we primarily discuss "simple
problem solving" or what I call "One-to-One" problems, where one
concept you learned directly addresses the problem.
</p>

<p>
You can reach level three by solving numerous practice questions and
problems. Many practice papers and quizzes include questions at the
"Applying" level, such as building a simple function in coding using
basic variables.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf1e49cd" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf1e49cd">The Four Level: "Analyzing"</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf1e49cd">
<p>
Now, regarding the more complex problems—these fall under level four
thinking. This level is all about "Analyzing." It involves <i>comparing
and contrasting, identifying similarities and differences</i>. This is
the first phase where we look at information concerning another piece
of information. Various techniques aid level four analysis, such as
Venn diagrams, tables, summaries that clarify similarities and
differences, and mind maps.
</p>

<p>
To access the level four result—comparison—you'll find questions that
prompt you to evaluate various concepts in relation to one another. A
useful study tip is to use tools like ChatGPT or Gemini and input
prompts to obtain questions tailored to your educational needs. For
instance, if you're studying microbiology for a second-year university
level, you can ask for questions based on Bloom’s revised taxonomy.
</p>

<p>
<b>Prompt:</b> Give me a questions at 2nd year university level for
Microbiology at Bloom's revised taxonomy level 4.
</p>

<p>
This technique is beneficial for your study because Bloom's Revised
Taxonomy was designed for educators and exam writers, not individual
learners. Almost every curriculum is structured around Bloom's
taxonomy or similar frameworks, meaning your exam writers are
constructing questions to distinguish between competent and
exceptional learners. This allows you to predict the types of
questions they might ask and even create your own practice papers.
</p>

<p>
However, level four thinkers are rare because moving from level three
to level four requires more mental effort. It is more challenging than
previous levels, demanding deeper, longer thinking. While this may
seem to slow you down, it allows your brain to form a more robust
understanding and stronger memory. Unfortunately, many students opt
not to think at level four because it feels more difficult,
illustrating a phenomenon known as the "Misinterpreted Effort
Hypothesis," which hinders their progress.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5bba8a6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5bba8a6">The Fifth Level: "Evaluating"</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5bba8a6">
<p>
Level five thinking is what top learners engage in. If you think at
level five, you will achieve top results. However, this level can also
be confusing. Level five is about "Evaluating." At this stage, <i>after
analyzing, comparing, and contrasting</i>, we are left with the question:
</p>

<p>
<b>"So what? Why does this matter?"</b>
</p>

<p>
Learning to think at this level leads to the ability to "Prioritize."
This can be demonstrated through the same AI inquiry technique we used
previously. Notice the distinction between level four and level five
questions; level five calls for conclusions that require
justification, unlike level four, which primarily addresses
similarities and differences.
</p>

<p>
Level five thinking takes considerable effort. You’re doing it right
when you find yourself going back and forth between the material,
considering questions such as “Why does this matter? How does it fit
with everything else? Why should I care?” This process might involve
transitioning between your lectures, textbooks, and even conducting
Google searches. It’s more challenging than previous levels, but to
achieve results at levels five and six will require moving through
them.
</p>

<p>
Level four and level five thinking are the types of problems and
challenges you’ll encounter in your second and third years of
university and in postgraduate studies. Most assessments will require
levels four and five thinking. Moreover, any senior position in any
profession will typically necessitate levels four and five
thinking. Much like before, the emphasis is less about which
techniques you use and more about what's occurring in your mind.
</p>

<p>
Techniques such as mind maps, teaching others, answering questions,
and creating summaries are all effective for level five, but it's
vital to engage with them at that cognitive level. For instance, it's
easy to create a mind map by simply connecting lines and arrows
between words and categories. However, this does not truly represent
level five thinking. That entails critically evaluating which
relationships are more significant and determining the most effective
way to group ideas.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd3b287c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd3b287c">Sixth Level: "Creating"</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd3b287c">
<p>
Level six will be covered more briefly because, paradoxically, it is
less critical for most people. Level six involves <i>creating hypotheses
and synthesizing new ideas from existing knowledge</i>. This level is
referred to as "Creating," and it leads to the result of
"Hypothesizing."
</p>

<p>
It's a common misconception that level six encompasses any situation
requiring you to generate knowledge. In reality, it only qualifies as
level six if you’re producing answers to questions where you couldn’t
find the answer in your existing knowledge. You’re identifying a gap
and crafting a potential answer based on your current understanding.
</p>

<p>
The reason level six is less crucial than the previous levels is that
most individuals won’t engage at this level unless they are pursuing
advanced education or in specialized professions. In daily life, most
people perform optimally by consistently functioning at level
five. Nonetheless, here are some examples of level six thinking; these
are <i>quite advanced</i>. You can pause to read them or prompt your AI for
similar examples in your own subjects.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org65dc6b3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org65dc6b3">The Essence</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org65dc6b3">
<p>
Now, here’s a mind-blowing approach: If you want to achieve levels
five and six, there are actually two different methods to get
there. The first method is to start studying and proceed through each
level from bottom to top. You first remember, then understand, apply,
analyze, and so forth. While this approach seems logical, it is often
not effective for many learners.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga346a2d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga346a2d">The Flaw</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga346a2d">
<p>
The problem with mastering each level sequentially is that it's
time-consuming, and most people lack the time to reach level five, let
alone master it. In reality, most learners engage with multiple levels
simultaneously, fluctuating between them. For example, during
lectures, they might touch on level one concepts followed by level
two, and later tackle quizzes that require both level two and level
three thinking. Challenging questions may necessitate level four and
level five thinking.
</p>

<p>
However, this method doesn’t work effectively because knowledge tends
to decay over time, a phenomenon known as the "forgetting curve."
While you engage with levels two and three, your grasp of level one
diminishes. Instead of ascending through the levels, you spend much of
your time relearning information you continually forget.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5708b3e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5708b3e">The Solution</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5708b3e">
<p>
Instead, a better approach is:
</p>

<p>
<b>to start at level five and work downward</b>
</p>

<p>
Remember that level six is less relevant for most learners. This
approach works because you process and retain information more
effectively at level five than at level one.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When you aim for the top, your brain fills in the lower-level
knowledge as a byproduct.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you focus on learning to regurgitate material, your brain won’t
instinctively learn to compare or prioritize information. However, if
you strive to evaluate and prioritize, you will enhance your memory,
enabling you to recall, explain, and solve problems more efficiently.

<h2 id="orgf05e6ba">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf05e6ba">
<p>
Each level plays a crucial role in developing cognitive skills,
starting from basic memorization to higher-order thinking.
</p>

<p>
Intentionality in learning is significant. It’s not just about the
techniques used for studying; it’s crucial how those techniques are
applied mentally. Understanding a concept goes beyond rote
memorization and requires a deeper engagement with the material.
</p>

<p>
Higher levels of thinking, particularly "Analyzing" and "Evaluating,"
require greater cognitive effort and are less common among
students. However, engaging at these levels leads to a more robust
understanding of the material.
</p>

<p>
Mastering the six levels of thinking is vital for students and
learners. It is essential to engage with these levels purposefully to
overcome challenges in learning and to achieve the best possible
outcomes.
