What is CI/CD? How does it help us ship faster? Is it worth the
hassle? Let’s take a look. CI/CD, or Continuous Integration and
Continuous Delivery, automates the software development process from
the initial code commit all the way through to deployment. It
eliminates much of the manual human intervention traditionally
required to get new code to production. The CI/CD process takes care
of building, testing, and deploying new code to production. The
promise is that it enables software teams to deploy better-quality
software faster. This all sounds very good, but does it work in real
life?
</p>

<p>
The answer is - it depends. Let’s break up CI/CD into their own parts
and discuss them separately.

<p>
<b>CI</b> is less controversial and more common.
</p>

<p>
In a nutshell, it is the practice of using automation to enable teams
to merge code changes into the shared repository early and often. Each
commit triggers an automated workflow on a CI server that runs a
series of tasks to make sure the commit is safe to merge into the main
branch. A good CI process relies on a set of good tests.
</p>

<p>
It is non-trivial to maintain a set of tests with sufficient coverage
that is not flakey. High test coverage usually takes longer to
run. This impacts developer productivity.
</p>

<p>
It is a tough balancing act, but it is worth the effort to get it
right. What are some common tools used in CI? A good source code
management system is the foundation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Github</b> is a very popular example. It should hold everything needed
to build the software. This includes source code, test scripts, and
scripts to build the software applications.
</p>

<p>
There are many tools to manage the CI process itself. <b>Github Actions</b>
and <b>Buildkite</b> are some modern examples. <b>Jenkins, CircleCI</b>, and
<b>TravisCI</b> are also common.
</p>

<p>
These tools manage the build and test tasks in CI. There are many test
tools for writing and running tests. These tools are usually language
and ecosystem specific.
</p>

<p>
For example, for JS, <b>Jest</b> is an example of the unit testing
framework, while playwright and cypress are some common integration
testing frameworks for web applications. The build tools are even more
diverse and ecosystem specific. <b>Gradle</b> is a powerful build tool for
Java.
</p>

<p>
The Javascript build ecosystem is fragmented and hard to keep track
of. <b>Webpack</b> is the standard, but many new build tools claim to be
much faster, but they are not yet as extensible as webpack.
</p>

<p>
Now let’s examine the CD part of CI/CD.

<p>
<b>CD</b> is continuous deployment. If we are being truthful, real
continuous deployment is hard. They do exist, but the practice is not
as common as CI.
</p>

<p>
Many teams only practice CD on the most basic types of systems. These
systems are usually stateless, like the API or web server tiers. With
good production monitoring, these systems could be deployed
continuously with minimal risks.
</p>

<p>
They are stateless, and rollbacks are usually quick and harmless. It
is also a common practice to wrap new features in feature flags to
separate The deployment of the code from the activation of the
features. This allows the team to quickly shut off new features if
they cause any issues without requiring a full rollback.
</p>

<p>
Canary deployment is also a common practice for products with hundreds
of millions of users. It deploys the new production code to a tiny
subset of the power users and staff who both appreciate new features
and have the risk appetite to help catch problems before the new code
is deployed widely. This allows the team to test the new code in a
real-world environment while limiting the blast radius if something
goes wrong.
</p>

<p>
These techniques work well for simple stateless systems. On the other
hand, very few teams have the resources or the convictions to
implement real continuous, hands-off deployment on complex stateful
systems Like database backend clusters or other types of stateful
systems like a websocket cluster. Instead, these systems are usually
on a fixed deploy cadence.
</p>

<p>
The deployment process is manual, risky and time consuming. They
require the care of a dedicated platform team. It is rare to see these
systems deploy fully continuously and automatically.
</p>

<p>
What are some tools that are used for CD? The tools we mentioned
earlier like <b>Github Actions, Buildkite</b> and <b>Jenkins</b> are commonly
used to handle CD tasks. There are also infrastructure-specific tools
that make CD easier to maintain. For example, on <b>Kubernetes, ArgoCD</b>
is popular.

<p>
In conclusion, CI/CD is a powerful software development practice that
can help teams ship better-quality software faster. However, it's not
a one-size-fits-all solution and its implementation may vary depending
on the complexity of the system.
